      <h3 id="doomphone-background">Background</h3>
      <p>
        In late 2017 I was a new hire on a small (maybe 10 person) IT team. We
        generally had an option to take hardware for ourselves if the
        alternative was to be thrown out. Everyone in our office was issued a
        Polycom desk phone, and occasionally they were retired in favor of newer
        models. One afternoon we upgraded a user's phone, and I took my
        opportunity. That night I went home with a Polycom VXX600 and a mission
        to make it run DOOM.
      </p>
      <p>
        The VXX600 has a standard 12-keypad, a "Home" button, volume rocker, and
        three buttons to mute, use the speaker, or use a headset. This is
        standard for most polycom phone models, but the VXX600 also comes
        equipped with a touch screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The phone has a basic web browser intended for 3rd party IT teams to
        provision custom apps to their users. I created a basic html page with{' '}
        <Code>&lt;input type='file' /&gt;</Code> to browse the file system.
      </p>
      <CenterImg
        src={polycomFileBrowser}
        alt="Polycom phone file browser"
        width="480px"
      />
      <p>
        <Italic>Nice.</Italic> It runs linux, <Italic>this will be easy</Italic>
        . Using the file browser I can view the entire file system, create
        directories, and with the touch screen I can drag and drop files and
        directories into <Italic>subdirectories</Italic>. Because of how the
        file browser works there is no way to move objects to a parent
        directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately the ability to move files didn't get me closer to hacking the
        phone and I needed a new strategy. Polycom has a{' '}
        <a href="http://voipt2.polycom.com/">large list of firmware versions</a>{' '}
        and allows you to freely upgrade/downgrade to any version supported by
        your model. <Italic>Perhaps I can exploit that...</Italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each night after work I tried to reverse engineer Polycom's firmware to
        give myself a backdoor. Every attempt to update my phone using custom
        firmware was rejected. These phones are also{' '}
        <Italic>painfully slow</Italic>. A full update cycle runs more than 10
        minutes, so I was unlikely to make progress by trying more of the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I did the rational thing and gave up. But I gained knowledge and
        experience â€” a worthy trade. I'll admit, in retrospect this was a really
        ambitious task. I also have a tendency to underestimate difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nobody succeeds in the software industry without tenacity. I don't know
        what came over me in May '21, almost 4 years later. Maybe it was a
        subconscious feeling of defeat. So I did the irrational thing and bought
        a refurbished Polycom VXX600.
      </p>

      <h3>A Brief Word of Wisdom</h3>
      <p>
        Between 2017 and today I've worked the majority of my professional
        career. Since then I've learned that the most vulnerable parts of a
        system are the parts whose users are trusted by the developer. These
        parts of the system are always the lowest priority for security
        assessment and patching for two reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        1. Nobody buys a Polycom phone because it has a good admin interface.
        Polycom sells phones because they provide a product that looks polished,
        affordable, and suitable for their customer. That means Polycom spends
        more resources (employee time) developing end-user features, and fewer
        resources developing tools to provision and administrate.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Developers are eventually forced to trust the end user won't
        maliciously use a feature to damage the system. If IT personnel abuse
        admin privileges to the company's Polycom phones it's a problem for the
        company, not Polycom.
      </p>

      <CenterImg
        src={doomphone1}
        width="600px"
        alt="Polycom phone running DOOM"
      />

      <h3 id="doomphone-hacking-the-phone">Hacking the Phone</h3>
      <p>
        With that wisdom in mind, let's see if we can find a vulnerability in
        the VXX600's admin interface. When factory reset, I can login to my
        phone's admin settings using password <Code>456</Code>. Poking around
        reveals a section titled "Web Server Configuration". Let's enable that
        and save settings. The phone will reboot itself.
      </p>
      <CenterImg
        src={polycomAdminWebserver}
        width="480px"
        alt="Polycom phone's admin screen for web server configuration"
      />
      <p>
        Now I can login from my PC's web browser. My phone is wired via
        ethernet, and from my router I see it is connected on IP{' '}
        <Code>192.168.1.4</Code>. Login using the same admin password that gave
        us access on the phone, <Code>456</Code>.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we're here, lets make sure the microbrowser is enabled so later we
        can use the phone's file manager. I also set the home page to my PC so I
        can host any html/js for the phone to render.
      </p>
      <CenterImg
        src={polycomAdminBrowser}
        width="600px"
        alt="Polycom webserver admin screen for microbrowser"
      />
      <p>Let's see what else exists in this interface...</p>
      <CenterImg
        src={uploadBackgroundUi}
        width="600px"
        alt="Polycom webserver admin screen to upload a custom background image"
      />
      <p>
        We can upload our own file as a background image. <Italic>Cool.</Italic>{' '}
        I bet we can exploit this, let's take a closer look at the request.
      </p>
      <CenterImg
        src={uploadBackgroundRequest}
        width="600px"
        alt="Request body from upload background image"
      />
      <p>
        Next let's replicate this from our favorite programming language. I
        chose C# because it has the tools I need.{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/NeilBostian/DoomPhone/blob/main/UploadFile/Program.cs">
          Check out the source here
        </a>
        . The server responded with <Code>OK 200</Code>, but the response text
        says <Code>INTERNAL_ERROR</Code>. I think we need to find this file to
        make sure it exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously in the admin UI I enabled my phone's web browser and set the
        home page to <Code>http://192.168.1.101:5000</Code> (my PC). Let's spin
        up a web server with debug tools.{' '}
        <a href="https://github.com/NeilBostian/DoomPhone/tree/main/WebServer">
          See the source here
        </a>
        . The file was uploaded to <Code>/rfs0/helloworld.txt</Code> and our
        debug tools show the contents match what we uploaded.{' '}
        <Italic>Sweet.</Italic>
      </p>
      <CenterImg
        src={helloWorld}
        width="480px"
        alt="Contents of 'helloworld.txt' file we uploaded"
      />
      <p>
        Further investigation shows that if the <Code>fileName</Code> parameter
        in our C# script contains a relative path, the file is still uploaded
        but in a different directory.{' '}
        <Italic>
          Note: I tried this with multiple firmware versions, it was fixed in
          one of the 5.9.x minor patches. The entirety of my work was completed
          using firmware <a href="http://voipt2.polycom.com/590/">5.9.0</a>,
          which contains the relative path exploit.
        </Italic>
      </p>
      <p>
        So where do we stand:
        <ul style={{ listStyleType: 'none' }}>
          <li>âœ” We can create new directories</li>
          <li>âœ” We can create new files with specific content</li>
          <li>âœ” We can move files and directories (with some caveats)</li>
        </ul>
        Now we need to figure out which files/directories to add that will blow
        this wide open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's check the boot sequence. We can view the contents of all the below
        files using our webserver debug tool.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Code>/etc/init.d/rcS</Code> runs on system boot and launches each
          script in <Code>/etc/rcS.d/S*</Code>.
        </li>
        <li>
          I could create a script that matches the pattern{' '}
          <Code>/etc/rcS.d/S*</Code>, but the file upload probably doesn't save
          files with execute permission. That means the script won't be run.
          Let's keep looking...
        </li>
        <li>
          <Code>/etc/rcS.d/launchapp</Code> starts another init script,{' '}
          <Code>/usr/local/etc/init.d/rcS</Code>:
        </li>
      </ul>

      <CopyBlock
        text={`# Startup any daemon scripts
for e in \`ls -1 /usr/local/etc/rcS.d/S* 2> /dev/null\`;
do
  if echo $e | grep "S70dbus"; then
    . $e
  else
    $e
  fi
done`}
        language="shell"
        showLineNumbers={true}
        theme={github}
      />

      <p>
        <Italic>Hell yeah, that's what we've been looking for.</Italic> For some
        reason, script <Code>/usr/local/etc/rcS.d/S70dbus</Code> couldn't be
        executed directly and was sourced into the shell that was already
        executing
        <Code>/usr/local/etc/init.d/rcS</Code>. See line 5, <Code>. $e</Code>.
        One nice feature of{' '}
        <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/114301">sourced scripts</a> is
        they don't require execute permissions on the sourced file. Thankfully
        whoever left this here checked equality using grep, so if we upload a
        file named <Code>S70dbus-neil-bootstrap.sh</Code> it should run on
        system boot.
      </p>
      <p>Using our web server / file browser, create directories</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Code>/usr/local/1</Code> â€” We'll write a shell script that watches
          this directory and executes anything we drop into it
        </li>
        <li>
          <Code>/usr/local/2</Code> â€” This stores the output logs from the
          scripts we drop in directory <Code>1</Code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Next we upload a file using our C# script:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Code>
            fileName = "../usr/local/etc/rcS.d/S70dbus-neil-bootstrap.sh";{' '}
          </Code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Code>fileContent = ". /usr/local/neil-hack.sh &amp;";</Code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then we upload <Code>neil-hack.sh</Code>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <Code>fileName = ""</Code>
        </li>
        <li>
          <Code> fileContent: </Code>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <CopyBlock
        text={`DIR=/usr/local/1

  do

    FILENAME="$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S_)$(basename $file).txt"
    . $file > "$LOG/$FILENAME" 2>&1
    rm $file
  done

  sleep 1
done`}
        language="shell"
        showLineNumbers={true}
        theme={github}
      />
      <p>
        Finally, we reboot our phone. On startup, <Code>neil-hack.sh</Code> will
        run in the background waiting for us to drop scripts into dir{' '}
        <Code>/usr/local/1</Code>.
      </p>
    </>
  );
}
